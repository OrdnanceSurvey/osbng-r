#' \code{osbng}: Access the British National Grid (BNG) index system
#' 
#' \code{osbng} provides a programmatic interface to Ordnance Survey's British
#' National Grid (BNG) index system, supporting efficient grid-based spatial
#' indexing and analysis. This enables applications such as statistical
#' aggregation, data visualisation, and data interoperability using BNG grid
#' references. Designed for developers working with geospatial data in the
#' context of Great Britain, the library offers tools to simplify working with
#' the BNG, facilitating both technical integration into geospatial workflows
#' and practical exploration of the index system's structure.
