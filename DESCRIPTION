Description: Offers a streamlined programmatic interface to Ordnance Survey's 
    British National Grid (BNG) index system, enabling efficient spatial 
    indexing and analysis based on grid references. It supports a range of 
    geospatial applications, including statistical aggregation, data 
    visualisation, and interoperability across datasets. Designed for 
    developers and analysts working with geospatial data in Great Britain, 
    'osbng' simplifies integration with geospatial workflows and provides 
    intuitive tools for exploring the structure and logic of the BNG system.
