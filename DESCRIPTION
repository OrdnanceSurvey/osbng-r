Description: A programmatic interface to Ordnance Survey's British National Grid
    (BNG) index system, supporting efficient grid-based spatial indexing and 
    analysis. The BNG enables applications such as statistical aggregation, data
    visualisation, and data interoperability using BNG grid references. Designed
    for developers working with geospatial data in the context of Great Britain,
    'osbng' offers tools to simplify working with the BNG, facilitating both 
    technical integration into geospatial workflows and practical exploration of
    the index system's structure.
